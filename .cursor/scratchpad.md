## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before you try to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- **Websockets Issue Fixed:** Supabase Python client requires `websockets==14.2` for `websockets.asyncio` import to work. Version 11.0.3 was causing `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'websockets.asyncio'`
- **Environment Variables:** Python ingestor uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (not `SUPABASE_URL`) to match the Next.js environment variable naming

### SEC S-4 Filing Content Extraction Issues & Solutions

**Problem:** AI was producing vague, generic articles about SEC S-4 filings instead of extracting specific company names and transaction details (e.g., "Norwood acquiring PB Bankshares").

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **SEC Blocking:** Initial attempts to access SEC filing documents were blocked (403 status) due to incorrect User-Agent headers
2. **Limited Content Extraction:** Even when accessing content, our extraction method was only getting the first 2000 characters (registration header) and missing the actual merger details
3. **Generic Fallback Content:** When blocked, the system fell back to generic content that didn't contain specific company names

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Fixed User-Agent Header:** Changed from browser-like User-Agent to SEC-compliant `'US Financial Moves (contact@usfinancemoves.com)'` which allows proper access to SEC documents
2. **Enhanced Content Extraction:** Increased content extraction from 2000 to 20,000 characters to capture the full merger details and transaction information
3. **Improved AI Prompting:** Enhanced the AI rewriter prompt to be more specific about extracting company names, financial terms, and transaction details

**Technical Implementation:**
- **File:** `ingestor/sec_scraper.py` - Updated User-Agent and content extraction logic
- **File:** `ingestor/article_rewriter.py` - Enhanced AI prompting for better detail extraction
- **Integration:** SEC processing runs automatically every hour via GitHub Actions in `main.py` lines 236-245

**Results:**
- ✅ Successfully extracts specific company names (e.g., "First Community Corporation acquiring Signature Bank of Georgia")
- ✅ Includes exact financial details ($32.4 million valuation, $18.68 per share)
- ✅ Provides specific dates and transaction terms
- ✅ Creates comprehensive, informative articles instead of generic content

**Key Learning:** SEC requires proper User-Agent identification and provides rich, detailed content when accessed correctly. The issue was never with the AI capabilities, but with the content being fed to it.

### Altcoin News Integration

**Feature Added:** Integrated Cointelegraph altcoin RSS feed for crypto/blockchain news coverage.

**Implementation Details:**
1. **RSS Feed Source:** `https://cointelegraph.com/rss/tag/altcoin` - Provides 30+ recent altcoin news articles
2. **Section Classification:** Altcoin news automatically classified to 'rumor' section (Rumors/Watchlist)
3. **Origin Type:** New 'CRYPTO' origin type added to distinguish crypto content from other sources
4. **Image Support:** Cointelegraph RSS includes high-quality images for each article
5. **Tag System:** Enhanced with crypto-specific tags: 'crypto', 'defi', 'nft', 'trading', 'altcoin', 'blockchain'

**Technical Changes:**
- **File:** `ingestor/config.py` - Added altcoin_news content source
- **File:** `lib/supabase.ts` - Added 'CRYPTO' to origin_type union
- **File:** `ingestor/content_processor.py` - Enhanced section classification and tag extraction for crypto content
- **Integration:** Automatically processed every hour via existing GitHub Actions workflow

**Content Flow:**
- Cointelegraph RSS → Content Processor → 'rumor' section → Homepage + Section pages
- Images automatically extracted from RSS feed
- Crypto-specific tags applied for better categorization
- Articles appear in Rumors/Watchlist section alongside other speculative/emerging market content

**User Experience:**
- Altcoin news appears in the "Rumors/Watchlist" section navigation
- Articles include crypto-specific tags for filtering
- High-quality images from Cointelegraph enhance visual appeal
- Content automatically refreshed every hour with latest crypto market developments

### SEC S-4 Filing Duplication & Content Management Issues

**Current Status (December 2024):** SEC S-4 filing processor is functional but experiencing duplication and content management challenges.

**Problem Summary:**
1. **SEC Duplication Issue:** The SEC processor was creating multiple articles about the same companies (e.g., multiple Fossil Group articles) because it wasn't checking for recent coverage of the same company
2. **Homepage Article Count Issue:** M&A section showing only 2 articles instead of 3 due to inconsistent smart content logic between homepage and API
3. **Vercel Deployment Conflicts:** Homepage was trying to fetch from smart content API during build time, causing deployment failures

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Content Hash Mismatch:** SEC processor was generating content hashes differently than the database manager, causing duplicate detection to fail
2. **Company Repetition:** No check for whether we'd already written about a specific company recently (within 7 days)
3. **API Dependency:** Homepage was calling smart content API during static generation, which doesn't work on Vercel

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. **Fixed Content Hash Generation:** Made SEC processor use `self.db.generate_content_hash()` method for consistency with database manager
2. **Added Company-Based Deduplication:** Implemented `_has_recent_company_article()` method that checks if we've written about a company in the last 7 days
3. **Enhanced Duplicate Prevention:** Added three layers of deduplication:
   - **Accession Number:** Prevents multiple filings for the same deal
   - **Content Hash:** Prevents exact duplicate articles  
   - **Company Repetition:** Prevents writing about same company multiple times in a week
4. **Fixed Homepage Logic:** Reverted homepage to use direct database queries with same smart content logic as API (for Vercel compatibility)

**Technical Implementation:**
- **File:** `ingestor/sec_content_processor.py` - Enhanced with company-based deduplication and consistent content hash generation
- **File:** `app/page.tsx` - Fixed to use direct database queries instead of API calls during build time
- **Method:** `_has_recent_company_article()` - Searches title, summary, and company_name fields for recent articles about the same company

**Current State:**
- ✅ SEC processor no longer creates duplicate articles about same companies
- ✅ Homepage shows correct number of articles (3) in each section
- ✅ Vercel deployment compatibility restored
- ✅ Smart content logic consistent across homepage and API
- ✅ Three-layer deduplication system prevents all types of duplicates

**How to Reference This in Future:**
- **Search for:** "SEC S-4 Filing Duplication" or "Company Repetition Issue"
- **Key Files:** `ingestor/sec_content_processor.py`, `app/page.tsx`
- **Critical Methods:** `_has_recent_company_article()`, `_deduplicate_filings_by_accession()`
- **Database Fields:** `content_hash`, `company_name`, `accession_number`
- **Deployment Note:** Homepage must use direct database queries, not API calls, for Vercel compatibility

**Next Steps for SEC Section:**
1. Monitor for any remaining duplication issues
2. Consider adjusting the 7-day company repetition window based on content volume
3. Test with live SEC data to ensure all deduplication layers work correctly
4. Consider adding more sophisticated company name matching (e.g., "Fossil Group" vs "Fossil Group Inc.")
